Related to the topic of topological orderings is the topic of shortest and longest paths on directed acyclic graphs.

Recall that a directed acyclic graph is a graph with directed edges and NO cycles. By definition this means all trees are automitically DAGs since they do not contain any cycles.

Here is a graph, my question to you is: Is this graph a directed a cyclic graph?

The answer is yes it is!

What about this structure? I'll give u a moment to think about it.

The answer no because this graph has undirected edges not directed edges. The graph may be a tree but directed edges are a requirement on DAG.
