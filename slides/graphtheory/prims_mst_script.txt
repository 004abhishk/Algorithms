Hello everybody, what's happening? My name is William and today we're talking 
about minimum spanning trees, and in particular how to use Prim's algorithm to
find them.

3.
So, what is a minimum spanning tree? On a weighted graph, a minimum spanning 
tree (or MST for short) is a tree which spans the whole graph connecting all 
nodes together while minimizing the total edge cost. It's important to note that
your spanning tree cannot contain any cycles, otherwise it's not a tree.

4.
Here's a weighted graph with nodes labeled 0 through 6 with various edges of 
different weights connecting them.

5.
One possible minimum spanning tree is the following edges highlighted in green
whose edge costs sum to 9. There's no way to cannot all the nodes together and 
get a lower cost than this. Note that even though the minimum spanning tree in
this graph is unique in general it's possible for a graph to have multiple MSTs
of equal costs.

6.
Hopefully you've been paying attention because now it's your turn. I'm going to
present you some weighted graphs and you need to identify any possible MST you
can. Let's begin with this graph; take a moment and find any MST on this graph.

One possible MST is the following with a cost of 14. Again, MSTs are not unique
so there could be other valid minimum spanning trees, but they'll all have a 
cost of 14.

8. 
Let's do another one, can you find a minimum spanning tree here? I'll give 
you a moment, but feel free to pause the video if you need.

Here's a possible answer with the MST highlighted in green and a cost of 39

10.
What about this graph? I promise it's the last one.

This is a bit of a trick question because there's no MST. All nodes must to 
connected on a single component for a spanning tree to exist.
