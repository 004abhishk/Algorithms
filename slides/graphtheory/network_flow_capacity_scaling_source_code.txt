Hello and welcome,
My name is William, today we're going to have a look at some source code for 
the Capacity Scaling algorithm.

In the previous video, I explained what Capacity Scaling is, how it works
and what it is good for, so I highly recommend watching that video before 
proceeding, there will be a link in the description. All the source code for 
this can be found on Github at github.com slash william fiset slash algorithms

Alright, here we are in the source code written in Java, I have laid out some
instructions here in case you wanted to download the code, play around with it
and run it yourself.
