Trees are a special form of graph

They come in directed and undirected flavors

Definitions:
An acyclic connected graph
A connected graph with N-1 edges
A graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path


Rooted trees


child, parent

root node

Only the root node in a rooted tree doesn't have a parent, although sometimes it
could be useful for the root node to have itself as a parent (e.g filesystem).

leaf node - nodes with no children

subtrees

Binary tree is a tree for which every node has at most two child nodes

(steal examples from binary tree slides)
