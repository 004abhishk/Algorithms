Hello and welcome to this Graph Theory algorithms course, my name is William, 
and I will be your instructor throughout these videos!

Graph theory is the Mathematical study of the relationship between vertices and
edges in a network.
[Mention how graphs can represent just about anything].
Throughout this course we will be taking on a computer science approach to GT
and look at graph algorithms and how they are used and applied in the real world.

1) How graphs are represented and stored on a computer
2) Common graph theory problems
3) Breadth first search algorithm
4) Depth first search algorithm
5) Dijkstra's algorithm
6) Topological sort algorithm
7) Shortest/longest path on a acyclic graph
8) Bellman Ford's algorithm
9) Floyd-Warshall all pairs shortest path algorithm
10) Finding bridges/articulation points
11) Finding strongly connected components (Tarjan's)
12) Travelling salesman problem (TSP)

Q: Is the course free? Where can users find it?
