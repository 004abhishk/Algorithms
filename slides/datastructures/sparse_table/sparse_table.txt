Hello and welcome! My name is William and today we're taking a looking at sparse tables, a nieche data structure with a great time complexity for answering range queries.

Let's talk in what type of situation you might want to use a sparse table. Sparse tables
are all about doing efficent range queires on a static array. Usually we're dealing
with an integer array with immutable data that does not change. Some common types of range queires we're often iterested in answering include: finding the minimum value in a certain range, the sum of all values between two endpoints, the product of the values in an interval, and etc...
